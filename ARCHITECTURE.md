# Architecture

## Overview

`my-coding-agent` is a hand-rolled Python agent harness. There are no external agent frameworks — the entire agentic loop, tool dispatch, context management, and session persistence are implemented from scratch.

## Core Layers

### `engine/` — Execution Owner

The engine package owns all execution concerns: the LLM HTTP client, tool dispatch, tool definitions, and the top-level `AgentNode` that drives the agentic loop.

### `LLM` (`engine/llm/`)

The pure HTTP client. Owns the `httpx` session, calls `/v1/chat/completions`, and tracks every call in `self.llm_calls`. Construction performs no network I/O — the model's context window is probed lazily on first access to `context_window`. Key responsibilities:

- **`chat_completion(messages, tools, kind)`** — single POST to the LLM server; records token usage per call tagged by `kind` (`main`, `handoff`, `report`, `tool_router`, `tool_arg_correction`, `artifact_query`).
- **`available_models` / `context_window`** — fetch the model list and resolve/cache the context window (128k fallback when unreachable).
- **`_request_with_retry`** — retries transient connection/timeout failures with backoff.

### `ToolRouter` (`engine/routing.py`)

Holds the LLM client and selects the relevant tool subset for a message via **`route_tools(message, all_tools)`** — two-phase selection before each step: (1) keyword match on each tool's `tags`, (2) LLM fallback if phase 1 returns nothing outside the baseline. Baseline tools (`bash`, `read_file`, `read_tool_artifact`) are always included. Consumed only via `engine.routing` (e.g. `pipeline/nodes/tool_routing.py`); `pipeline/__init__.py` does not re-export it, keeping the `engine` → `pipeline` dependency one-way per the layered-dependency rule.

### `ToolExecutor` (`engine/tool_execution/` package)

Constructed **per assistant message** (`ToolExecutor(message, llm, tools=ctx.all_tools)`). Runs `before_tool_call` → `invoke_tool` → `after_tool_call` per call. Returns tool messages and records. Normalizes all results into the canonical `{schema_version, tool, ok, output, error, metadata}` envelope. For a `bash` result each datum maps to exactly one field — `stdout`→`output`, `stderr`→`error` (whenever non-empty, **regardless of `ok`**, so a masked pipeline failure surfaces as `ok:true` with a non-null `error`), `exit_code`→`metadata.exit_code`, success→`ok` — with nothing duplicated (`ok` is the sole success verdict; a non-null `error` does not imply failure). `result_envelope` only handles the single live artifact shape (a dict artifact carrying a preview) — no legacy fallbacks for shapes no tool produces. Every envelope also carries an advisory `metadata.lang = {command, output, error}` language hint (`lang.resolve_lang`, values `python`/`shell`/`json`/`text`) resolved from the tool name and args — `bash` command→`shell`, a `read_file` output→its file extension, else a JSON sniff, else `text` — so the trace viewer highlights each box without re-inferring; it never changes `output`/`error`/`ok`/`exit_code`. It makes no LLM calls itself — the LLM client is held only for the session log path and the observability recorder. Forwards the run's toolset **and its `llm` client** to the `ToolRegistry` so toolset-aware tools (notably `delegate`) and `read_tool_artifact`'s extraction call can use them.

When a tool output is large enough to offload — `bash` combined stdout+stderr, a `read_file` file, or a `read_article` page above `ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD` — the tool returns the `(None, artifact_dict)` contract (file/page content in the `stdout` slot) and `after_tool_call` bounds **each stream independently** (`_offload_streams`): a stream over the preview budget (`PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS`) has its **full content written to its own per-stream file** at `.my_coding_agent/<session>/artifacts/<tool_call_id>.<stream>.txt` (`stream` ∈ `stdout`/`stderr`) at creation time and its envelope field carries only a **bounded preview** — a token-bounded excerpt + inline guidance naming `read_tool_artifact(tool_call_id, query=...)` as the primary access path (bash text tools over the on-disk file remain a secondary path); a stream within budget is inlined. `output` carries the stdout preview/inline and `error` the stderr preview/inline, so a large stderr can no longer flood context. `metadata.preview` is keyed by offloaded stream (`{"stdout": {…}, "stderr": {…}}`, shown/total counts + `full_output_path`). The full raw stream never enters the context window; because each file persists for the run, any later step can query it. The path scheme (and its safe-id guard) lives in one place, `tool_registry.artifact_file_path(session_id, tool_call_id, stream)`, shared by the write side (executor) and the read side (`read_tool_artifact`) so the two can never drift. The on-disk write is fault-tolerant: if `mkdir`/`write_text` fails (full disk, permissions), `_write_artifact_file` logs a warning and returns `None` instead of aborting the run — offloading and the preview continue without an on-disk copy, and retrieval falls back to the in-memory store. The preview excerpt is built by `output.build_stream_preview`, applied per stream.

### `pipeline/` — DAG Building and Execution

The node-based DAG execution engine. `pipeline/` only knows how to build and execute a DAG — it has no knowledge of LLM client internals or session management.

**`RunContext` (`context.py`)** — the explicit data contract that flows through the pipeline. Holds immutable run config (session id, max steps, LLM client, recorder, all tools) and mutable state fields (messages, step_num, last_prompt_tokens, tool_records, tool_artifacts, handoff_records). Control signals (`signal`, `stop_reason`) are written by nodes and read by `Pipeline.execute`.

**`Node` protocol + `BaseNode` (`node.py`)** — a `Node` is any callable with a `name: str` and a `run(ctx: RunContext) -> None` method. Nodes read and write `ctx` in place.

**`Pipeline` (`dag.py`)** — takes an ordered list of `Node` objects. `run_step` executes every node in order for one step, short-circuiting when any node sets a non-`CONTINUE` signal. `execute` wraps `run_step` in the outer step loop.

**The five default nodes** (instantiated by `build_default_pipeline()`):

| Node | Stage | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ContextGuardNode` | 1 | Checks `last_prompt_tokens / context_window`; sets STOP (limit), RESET (handoff), or CONTINUE |
| `ToolRoutingNode` | 2 | Creates `ToolRouter(ctx.llm)`, calls `route_tools`, writes `ctx.routed_tools` |
| `LLMCallNode` | 3 | Increments `step_num`, calls `chat_completion`, appends assistant message |
| `ToolDispatchNode` | 4 | Builds `ToolExecutor(last_message, ctx.llm)`, runs it, merges records and artifacts into `ctx` |
| `FinalizeStepNode` | 5 | Reads `ctx.last_response`: records token usage + updates `ctx.last_prompt_tokens`, then sets STOP on a stop/exit/quit finish_reason (emits both `token_tracking` and `finish_check` records) |

### `AgentNode` (`engine/agent.py`)

The top-level entry point. Holds an `LLM` client via composition (`self.llm`) — not a subclass. `__init__` builds the client, assigns a session id, attaches the session log, and initializes run stats.

- **`execute(max_steps)`** — stand-alone entry: constructs a `RunContext`, builds the pipeline via `build_default_pipeline(spawn_fn=...)`, delegates to `pipeline.execute(ctx)`, saves session data, and prints the summary. `max_steps` defaults to the shared `DEFAULT_MAX_STEPS` (50) — the single source of truth used by the CLI, the `execute` default, and delegated subagents so all three share one step ceiling.
- **`run(ctx)`** — embedded entry: runs `execute()` and writes results back to the provided `RunContext`; used when `AgentNode` is a step in a larger outer pipeline.

`AgentNode` owns session bookkeeping: banner printing, session log attachment/detachment, `session_data.json` + `tool_artifacts.json` persistence, run summary, and observability recorder start/finish. It also owns `_generate_handoff`, `_spawn_continuation`, and `_handle_context_reset` — the context-reset machinery called by `ContextGuardNode` via the `spawn_fn` closure. A shared `_summarize_conversation(prompt, kind)` helper backs both `_generate_handoff` and `generate_report` — a single tool-free LLM call over the whole conversation; when the model returns empty `content` (reasoning models such as Qwen3-thinking often end the summary turn with a tool call, leaving `content` null and the substance in `reasoning_content`), it falls back to `reasoning_content` so the summary is never lost. `generate_report()` produces a subagent's end-of-turn final report (a distinct `report` node) and is invoked by the `delegate` tool after `execute()`, so it fires for delegated subagents only, never spontaneously for the main agent.

### Context Handoff (`pipeline/schema.py` + `pipeline/handoff.py` + `pipeline/nodes/context_guard.py`)

`pipeline/schema.py` holds the `ContextHandoff` dataclass shape only; `pipeline/handoff.py` holds the builder logic that operates on it — `save_handoff()` (persistence) and `handoff_to_user_message()` (rendering) — kept out of `schema.py` per the Schema Convention.

When `ContextGuardNode` detects that `prompt_tokens / context_window >= context_reset_threshold`, it calls `spawn_fn()` — a closure set by `AgentNode.execute` that calls `AgentNode._handle_context_reset`. That method:
1. Sends a structured handoff prompt asking the LLM to summarize progress, files changed, decisions made, and remaining work.
2. Saves the result as a markdown file under `.my_coding_agent/handoffs/` via `save_handoff()`.
3. Saves session data and prints a summary for the current run.
4. Spawns a fresh `AgentNode` instance carrying only the system messages and the handoff as a user message.

`ContextGuardNode` stores the result in `ctx.continuation_messages` and sets `ctx.signal = "RESET"`, which causes `Pipeline.execute` to return those messages immediately.

### `ToolRegistry` (`engine/tool_registry/` package)

A plain class whose methods are the tools the LLM can call:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bash(command)` | Runs a shell command; reports `stdout, stderr, exit_code, ok`; large combined output offloads |
| `read_file(file_path)` | Reads a file; files over `ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD` offload (lossless — the full content is stored, not truncated) |
| `write_file(file_path, content)` | Writes a file, creating parent dirs |
| `read_article(url)` | Fetches a URL and converts HTML → markdown; pages over `ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD` offload (lossless within a generous fetch-side sanity cap, `ARTICLE_FETCH_MAX_CHARS`) |
| `read_tool_artifact(tool_call_id, query)` | Queries a previously offloaded large output (`query` is required). Makes a bounded local-LLM extraction call (`artifact_query` kind) over the stored content and returns only a token-bounded extract relevant to `query` — never the full stored content, regardless of query, artifact size, or failure mode. Artifacts over the per-call input budget are scanned in sequential chunks so any part of the output is reachable, not just a prefix. Degrades to a bounded head excerpt + on-disk path hint when no LLM client is injected or the extraction call fails; an unknown `tool_call_id` returns a clear error naming it |
| `delegate(task, context)` | Spawns a fresh read-only subagent for a focused task; the subagent inherits the parent toolset **minus `delegate`** (to prevent recursive spawning) and runs with the same `DEFAULT_MAX_STEPS` budget as the main agent. Returns the subagent's LLM-summarized final report (`generate_report()`), not a scrape of its last message, so the final tool results survive even when the subagent is cut off at its step ceiling |

The `@tool` decorator converts any `ToolRegistry` method into an OpenAI-compatible tool definition by inspecting its signature and parsing Google-style docstrings.

### `observability/` — Passive Event Capture

Receives events emitted by `engine/` and `pipeline/`; never controls execution. Writing directly to `events.jsonl` is its only side-effect.

- **`recorder.py`** — event type constants (`SESSION_START`, `LLM_CALL`, `TOKEN_TRACKING`, `FINISH_CHECK`, `HANDOFF`, `REPORT`, etc.); `Recorder` appends events as newline-delimited JSON. `record_llm_call` captures each call's full input — the `messages` snapshot and the `tools` definitions given to the model that turn — for kinds in `FULL_PAYLOAD_KINDS` (both dropped otherwise to bound stream size). `record_report` captures a subagent's end-of-turn final report as a `REPORT` event, distinct from the context-reset `HANDOFF` event. Two `ContextVar`s (`current_session_id`, `current_recorder`) let delegated subagents record their parent link.

### `viewer/` — Active Read-Side (Trace Explorer)

The read-side of the observability system. Separated from `observability/` because it is **active** — it controls execution (HTTP server), renders output (embedded HTML), and manages file handles — whereas `observability/` is passive capture only (CONTRIBUTE.md §25).

- **`schema.py`** — `TraceNode` and `TraceSession` dataclasses: the typed contracts produced by `reader.py` and consumed by `server.py`. `TraceNode.ctx_state` holds the per-node context-window snapshot — cumulative `composition` by `system`/`user`/`assistant`/`tool` role, the per-role `added` this node appended (with `added_total`/`removed` and an `estimated` flag), plus `tokens`/`window`/`pct`. Each node also carries `agent` (owning session id) and `depth` (call-tree nesting level), so sub-agent traces nest under the main agent. `TraceSession.order` is the execution-order node spine the UI walks for keyboard navigation.
- **`pricing.py`** — model price table (USD per 1M tokens) and `compute_cost()` helper.
- **`reader.py`** — parses `events.jsonl` into a **flat** `TraceSession`: every pipeline `BaseNode` subclass (`ContextGuardNode`, `ToolRoutingNode`, `LLMCallNode`, `ToolDispatchNode`, `FinalizeStepNode`) becomes one `TraceNode` in a single chain off the session root — there is no `step` wrapper node; the step number is carried as an attribute. A subagent's `REPORT` event becomes a distinct `report` node (`Subagent Report`), separate from the context-reset `handoff` node. Reconstructs the context window as four role buckets in execution order (`_assign_ctx_state`): each node contributes the message(s) it appends — the session seeds system + opening user, an LLM call adds its `assistant` output (exact `completion`), a tool dispatch adds its result (character-estimated via a session tokens/char ratio, since tool tokens are never recorded); composition re-anchors to each LLM call's real input snapshot (`_role_split` splits the provider's flat `prompt_tokens` across the four roles by character share). Each agent gets its **own** context window: `_assign_ctx_state` processes only its session's nodes, so delegate sub-agents (loaded recursively at an incremented `depth` and grafted inline) keep the independent windows computed by their own load. Also does loop detection and aggregate analytics; falls back to `session_data.json` for sessions without `events.jsonl`.
- **`server.py`** — minimal stdlib `http.server` with three routes (`/`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/session/{id}`) and an embedded single-page Trace Explorer UI built with **Preact + htm** (vendored offline under `_vendor/`, injected inline — no CDN, no build step). The UI is a nested call-**Tree** (Main Agent at the root; each `delegate` spawns a collapsible **Subagent** group, with a coloured rail, nested where it was called — derived from each node's `agent`/`depth`) with keyboard navigation (auto-select), a type filter, and a single per-node **Context window** box (a system/user/assistant/tool composition bar + legend and the running total/%, badged with the owning agent for sub-agents since each tracks its own window); Each tree row shows the node's compact badges then its contribution summary (e.g. *+196 assistant*). Node detail leads with a **uniform header** shared by every node type — a single big **main badge** naming the node class (e.g. `ToolDispatchNode`, the `(tool)` suffix stripped since it appears as its own badge) and a badge row ordered by importance left→right: identity (tool name / llm kind / model) · status (✓/✗, colored) · colored type signals (📦 artifact, ✂️ truncated, 🧭 phase) · counts (N tools / N calls / N steps) · then de-emphasised housekeeping (⚡ latency, 🕘 timestamp, step); only badges whose data exists are shown, and the same `nodeBadges` set drives the compact tree badges. Below the header it is type-aware: a tool dispatch renders four labelled boxes — **command**, **output**, **error**, and the always-shown **raw_envelope** (`{schema_version, tool, ok, output, error, metadata}`) — each highlighted in its `metadata.lang` language, and empty output / absent error omitted so the raw envelope still guarantees an empty `output` whose real signal lives in `error` is never hidden. LLM calls render response/reasoning/tool-calls boxes, and a `report` node renders the subagent's final report content. An LLM call's **Inputs** surface both the `messages` snapshot and the `tools` definitions the model was given that turn. Every content box renders through one read-only `CodeBox` component wrapping a **CodeMirror 6** editor (vendored offline): a box takes an explicit language (`json`/`python`/`shell`/`text`, from the backend `metadata.lang` hint) or falls back to JSON-vs-text inference. It provides syntax highlighting, line numbers, folding, a JSON schema breadcrumb derived from the caret's syntax-tree path (clickable to jump; JSON only), collapse-all/expand-all, copy-all, and `@codemirror/search` find (open + Enter/Shift+Enter next/prev). Editors are created only for the selected node's visible boxes, so many-node sessions stay fast. CLI entry point: `my-coding-agent-traces [--port 7474] [--dir .my_coding_agent]`.
- **`_vendor/`** — third-party UI libraries (Preact, Preact Hooks, htm as UMD bundles; CodeMirror 6 as a prebuilt IIFE bundle exposing `window.CM6` with `json`/`python`/`shell` languages — shell via `@codemirror/legacy-modes`, no `lang-shell` package exists) vendored offline so the localhost viewer needs no internet. JS only; excluded from coverage.

### `utils/` — Generic Helpers

Active utilities that configure loggers and render to stderr — not passive, so they live outside `observability/`.

- **`logging_core.py`** — custom log levels `TOOL` (15), `API` (25), `LLM` (35); `ColoredFormatter`; `get_logger`; `_TeeStream` + `attach_session_log` / `detach_session_log` that tee stderr to per-session log files.
- **`terminal_ui.py`** — `print_banner` (startup box) and `print_run_summary` (end-of-run box with token chart); shared `_git_branch` helper; all row/section/chart sub-helpers. Both renderers write directly to `sys.stderr`, bypassing the logger formatter.

### Schema Convention

Every module and sub-module owns a `schema.py` for its typed contracts and shape definitions. Builder logic stays in its own module; `schema.py` holds constants, type aliases, and dataclasses only.

| Module | `schema.py` contents |
|---|---|
| `engine/schema.py` | Session/LLM/tool/handoff/report event type constants |
| `engine/llm/schema.py` | LLM call kind constants (`CALL_KIND_*`, sole source of truth — consumed by `agent.py`, `routing.py`, and every `pipeline/nodes/*.py` call site instead of raw string literals), usage field names |
| `engine/tool_execution/schema.py` | Canonical tool-result envelope shapes (builders live in `envelope.py`) |
| `engine/tool_registry/schema.py` | OpenAI tool definition JSON key names |
| `pipeline/schema.py` | ROUTER event type constant, `ContextHandoff` dataclass (builders live in `handoff.py`) |
| `observability/schema.py` | JSONL row top-level key names |
| `viewer/schema.py` | `TraceNode` + `TraceSession` dataclasses |

  │
  └── AgentNode (engine/agent.py)

## Session Persistence

Each run creates `.my_coding_agent/<session_id>/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `stderr.log` | Plain-text log of the full run |
| `stderr_colored.log` | Same log with ANSI color codes |
| `session_data.json` | Metrics, tool records, LLM call log, stop reason |
| `events.jsonl` | Structured observability event stream |
| `artifacts/<tool_call_id>.<stream>.txt` | Full content of each offloaded large output stream (`stdout`/`stderr`), written at creation so bash can skim it during the run |
| `tool_artifacts.json` | End-of-run audit dump of the in-memory artifact records |

Handoffs are saved under `.my_coding_agent/handoffs/`.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OMLX_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8321/v1` | OpenAI-compatible API base URL |
| `OMLX_API_KEY` | `changeme` | API key |
| `OMLX_MODEL` | `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` | Model ID |

The context window size is discovered lazily on first access to `LLM.context_window`.

When the `bash` tool's combined stdout/stderr exceeds the artifact threshold, the dispatcher offloads it to a per-stream file and substitutes a deterministic bounded preview — it does not generate an LLM summary.
